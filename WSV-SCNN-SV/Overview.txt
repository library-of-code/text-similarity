1.WSV-SCNN-SV stands for(Word set vectors , Shallow ConvolutionNN and Sentence Vector)
2.The model works in the same flow as mentioned above.

3.Ususally word vectors cannot convey the inner meaning of a sentence, for that we can use the binaray gram approach which transform the sentence word-vectors set into a 3d tensor of size n*n*d (d is word vector dimensionality)

4.The binary gramed tensor for the sentence is then passed to a shallow convolution-Neuralnet which outputs a sentence vector for comparison.for 

5.Fully connected layers are depricated from this model instead we use K-max pooling for creating end model sentence vector, for comparison.

6.Sentence vector similarity is done by comparing the cosine similarity b/w two output sentence-vectors.
